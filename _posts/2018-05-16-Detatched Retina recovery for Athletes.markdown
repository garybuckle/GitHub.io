# recovering from a detached retina.
[what is a detached retina](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/detached-retina-retinal-detachment/).

For anyone active in sports activities this is quite a traumatic experience.

That was certainly the case for me, coming in a period where I was getting ready for a marathon, challenging in local squash leagues and enjoying a high level of fitness.

I can think of no particular reason why this happened. No squash ball in the eye, no one punched me and I certainly had no trauma that I can recollect.

My first recollection of anything untoward was having floaters, actually in both eyes.
The diagnosis from  My first hospital visit was a retinal tear, he treatment for which is laser treatment and fairly standard.
Performed on the same day as my appointment, unfortunately it didn't work.

This meant I was forced to go in to the hospital two days later. This meant I was sent to another hospital for a deeper, more intensive operation to fix the tear.

It was there that I was informed I had a detached retina.
