garybuckle is just like you. He runs the odd marathon, plays a bit of squash, does 20 press ups everyday, eats too much chocololate but dreams of being a'proper' athlete. 
This website is just to get the stuff I do and think about, obsess about.......

Out there!!!! 

Why not use FaceBook???

I want Control!

I wanted to control everything about the page and not have to worry about anything else or anybody else.

People wont see your site without social media!

I know and I don't really care.

Enjoy!
