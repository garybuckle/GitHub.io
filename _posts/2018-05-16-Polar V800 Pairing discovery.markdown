# New Polar refuses to pair with Polar  Flow on iOS device

* error message is 'pairing failed'

Make sure that you remove the Bluetooth v800 entry under the Bluetooth menu on iOS. 
Otherwise although the device appears to pair, it actually does not pair and will say pairing failed even after entry of the pin code.
