So much for the data available on the internet.

For anyone active in sports activities experiencing a detached retina is quite a traumatic experience.

That was certainly the case for me, coming in a period where I was getting ready for a marathon, challenging in local squash leagues and enjoying a high level of fitness.
I can think of no particular reason why this happened.
No squash ball in the eye, no one punched me and I certainly had no trauma that I can recollect.

My first recollection of anything untoward was having floaters, actually in both eyes.
The diagnosis from  My first hospital visit was a retinal tear, he treatment for which is laser treatment and fairly standard.
Performed on the same day as my appointment, unfortunately it didn't work.
