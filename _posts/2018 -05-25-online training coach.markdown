# Using Online logging tools to guide your training


This is a very basic about how logging your fitness sessions can be useful as a motivational tool, sounds very obvious now that I'm writing this.

There are many options available, some free and some that you have to subscribe to.
The two big sports/fitness manufacturers Garmin and Polar both have very good online facilities and apps for capturing and displaying the data.
Other online portals or tools like [Training Peaks](www.trainingpeaks.com) are not free but very useful and comprehensive.


**Why log your exercises?

- When you start you will have done idea of where you want to get to and you will know where you are. You will continually strive to get to where you want to be but will easily forget where you started.
- Having a visual reminder of your efforts may inspire you.
- You may become obsessed with logging the workout. 
- You can workout effectively and not waste your valuable time.
- Others will see your efforts and comment.

So, again I can only offer my experience and my data.

My experience was that logging my workouts initially highlighted how poor my performance was when compared to what it was years ago. Rather than dishearten me though it gave me a ground zero starting point. Sort of, "I can only get better" approach.

As I progressed the progression that I could clearly see was inspiring.

Friends and family who commented on my workouts were encouraging and positive.

When I became very fit, I was able to take rest days in order to prevent burn out.

I became obsessed with logging, it made me get out of bed in the mornings when I envisaged hitting my target of 10 hours of Squash in a given week.

In essence my reward system was sufficiently triggered.

I installed positive habits in my life.


For the record I used Garmin and Polar flow, decisions driven by the use of equipment like gps watches and fitness trackers.

Previously I'd also used [Runkeeper](www.runkeeper.com)

Currently I use [Polar Flow](www.) and have the account linked to [Strave]()

So what does the Polar Flow service do for me?
