A list of the stuff I have used.

Heart Rate Sensors - Currently my best advice here is the [Polar H10](https://www.polar.com/uk-en/products/accessories//h10_heart_rate_sensor)
I have the H7 but the H10 would be the same..... but better!

# Sports Watches

I am currently sporting a [Polar Vantage V](https://www.polar.com/uk-en/vantage/v). Probably the best sports watch I have ever used!

[Here is an early review](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2018/09/the-new-polar-vantage-series-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know.html)

I have owned one since its introduction and although the watch is still missing a few features (firmware update to come).

It is a fantastic device.

I am avoiding my own reviews since there are so many out there but the one I would place highest is here:
