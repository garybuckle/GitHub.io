I have a very amateur interest in sports psychology. So my first entry here has to go to:

[Bounce - Mathew Syed's excellent book on Talent and practice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11398124-bounce). 

You will find all of his books here and Bounce  
is at the bottom. Great place to start.

Second is [Born to run](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7986569-born-to-run)
