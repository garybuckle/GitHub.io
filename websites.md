 Basically this page is a placeholder for stuff I've seen on the internet and told everyone I met about.
Months later the most important bits of the message are forgotten and my mantra becomes:

"What was the title of that post I saw about......."

The first entry has to be [That gut feeling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07ff0hl)
It's a podcast!

Next up is [Train Ugly](http://trainugly.com)

I love the focus on mindset, growth and learning from failure.
